# Hello 👋🏾

This is that corner of the internet where you can find the code I write and make public. Although at this time, I don't write much code and 
most code I write isn't ready for public view 😅 (I use function names like `DoThis` or `ProcessThatSh*t`)

But the hope is that I get around to cleaning it all up and sharing more work.

Other than writing code and managing a team, I cook a lot and run a lot more. So hit me up if you enjoy either of them or none of them either. 

If you want to read more about me, head on over to my [website](http://shrayas.com) or if you want to ping me, [twitter](https://twitter.com/shrayasr) is where I'm most active on
